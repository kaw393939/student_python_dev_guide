## Hands-on Assignments

The best way to learn is by doing! Complete these practical assignments to build real-world skills:

- [**Assignment 1: Virtual Environments and Pip**](assignments/01-virtual-env-pip.md)  
  Master Python package management, create isolated environments, and manage dependencies like a professional developer.

- [**Assignment 2: Code Quality with Pylint**](assignments/02-pylint-code-quality.md)  
  Learn static code analysis, understand PEP8 standards, and write cleaner, more maintainable Python code.

- [**Assignment 3: Testing with Pytest**](assignments/03-pytest.md)  
  Develop test-driven development skills, write effective test cases, and ensure your code works as expected.

Each assignment includes detailed instructions, example code, and reflection questions to deepen your understanding.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to begin your learning journey:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kaw393939/student_python_dev_guide.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd student_python_dev_guide

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (if applicable)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Purpose

This guide is designed for college students aiming to develop professional software engineering skills with Python. You'll learn:

- **Virtual Environments**: Create isolated development environments to avoid dependency conflicts
- **Package Management**: Use pip effectively to manage project dependencies
- **Testing**: Write automated tests to verify your code works correctly
- **Code Quality**: Follow industry standards for clean, maintainable code
- **CI/CD**: Implement continuous integration workflows using GitHub Actions

These skills are essential for internships, jobs, and personal projects, giving you a competitive edge in the software development industry.
