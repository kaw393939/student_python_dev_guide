## How to Use This Documentation

- **New to programming?** Start with [Project Setup](01-project-setup.md) and work through each guide in order.
- **Experienced developer?** Feel free to jump to specific sections that interest you.
- **Struggling with a concept?** Each guide includes a troubleshooting section for common issues.

## Practical Application

Throughout these guides, we'll use a simple calculator project to demonstrate concepts. While the calculator itself is straightforward, the development practices we apply are the same ones used in complex, professional applications.

Each documentation section provides step-by-step instructions with examples to help you understand these important development tools.

## Time Estimates

Depending on your experience level, expect to spend:
- 30-60 minutes reading each documentation section
- 2-4 hours completing each related assignment
- 10-15 hours for the entire course of study

## Further Resources

Each section includes links to additional resources for deeper learning on each topic.
