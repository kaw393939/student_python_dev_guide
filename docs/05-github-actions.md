# Automation with GitHub Actions

This guide explains how to set up continuous integration using GitHub Actions.

## Understanding GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipelines directly from GitHub.

Key components:
- **Workflows**: Automated procedures made up of one or more jobs
- **Jobs**: Sets of steps that execute on the same runner
- **Steps**: Individual tasks that run commands in a job
- **Actions**: Standalone commands combined into steps to create a job
- **Runners**: Servers that run your workflows

## Setting Up Your First Workflow

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository
2. Add a YAML file (e.g., `main.yml`) to define your workflow

Example workflow file:

```yaml
name: Python Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
        pip install pytest pylint
    
    - name: Lint with pylint
      run: |
        pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
    
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest
```

## Workflow Triggers

GitHub Actions workflows can be triggered by various events:

- **push**: When code is pushed to the repository
- **pull_request**: When a PR is opened, updated, or closed
- **schedule**: At scheduled times using cron syntax
- **workflow_dispatch**: Manually triggered by a user
- **repository_dispatch**: Triggered by external events

## Viewing Workflow Results

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Select the workflow run to view details
4. Check the logs for each job and step

## Common GitHub Actions for Python Projects

- **actions/checkout**: Check out your repository code
- **actions/setup-python**: Set up a Python environment
- **pip install**: Install dependencies
- **pytest**: Run tests
- **pylint/flake8**: Check code quality
- **codecov/codecov-action**: Upload coverage reports
- **pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish**: Publish packages to PyPI

## Advanced Configurations

### Matrix Testing

Test across multiple Python versions:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10']
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
```

### Caching Dependencies

Speed up workflows by caching pip packages:

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
```

## Security Best Practices

- Use secrets for sensitive information
- Limit permissions in workflow files
- Pin action versions to specific commits
